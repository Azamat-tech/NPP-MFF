2. Addition
Suppose that we represent natural numbers using structures: 0 = z, 1 = s(z), 
2 = s(s(z)) and so on. Write a predicate sum(I, J, K) that is true if I + J = K, 
where I, J, and K have this numeric representation. Your predicate should work in all directions.

3. Multiplication
Extending the previous exercise, write a predicate mul(I, J, K) that is true if I Â· J = K,

4. Integer Sum
Write a predicate sum(L, N) that is true if N is the sum of the integers in the list L.

7. Time Difference
Let the structure time(H, M, S) represent the 24-hour time H:M:S, where H, M, 
and S are integers. Write a predicate plus(T, N, Q) that is true if time T plus 
N seconds equals time Q. Your predicate should work in all directions.
